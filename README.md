## About Me
  I am a student of Analysis and Systems Development. With 31 years and i began in IT in 2018 as a Front-end Developer. 
I am self-tought, i learned HTML, CSS, and JS by myself. But to join the technology market i needed to get a certificate.
Because of this, i started a certificate program in Analysis and Systems Development, in SENAI, an institution that prepares professionals
for industry, very respected in all estates of Brazil and some countries arround the world.
